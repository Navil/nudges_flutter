<h3>Last Updated: 10.08.2017</h3>
Welcome to Nudges (“us,” “we,” the “Company”).

<h3>1. Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement. </h3>
By creating a Nudges account, whether through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively, the “Service”) you agree 
to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy and Safety Tips, each of which is incorporated by reference into 
this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features, products or services we 
offer on the Service (collectively, this “Agreement”). If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this 
Agreement, please do not use the Service.

We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Services from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to 
reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent version of this 
Agreement will be posted on this page, so you should regularly check it for the most recent version. If the changes include material 
changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could include 
notification through the Services or via email. If you continue to use the Services after the changes become effective, then you 
agree to the revised Agreement.

<h3>2. Eligibility.</h3>
You must be at least 16 years of age to create an account on Nudges and use the Service. By creating an account and using the Service, you represent and warrant that:
<ul>
<li>you can form a binding contract with Nudges</li>
<li>you are not a person who is barred from using the Service under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction–meaning that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition,</li>
<li>you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations, and</li>
<li>you have never been convicted of a felony and that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender registry.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Your Account.</h3>
In order to use Nudges, you may sign in using your Facebook login. If you do so, you authorize us to access and use certain Facebook 
account information, including but not limited to your public Facebook profile and information about Facebook friends you share in 
common with other Nudges users. For more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it, please 
consult our Privacy Policy.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use to sign up for Nudges, and you are solely 
responsible for all activities that occur under those credentials. If you think someone has gained access to your account, please 
immediately contact office@nudges.at.

<h3>4. Modifying the Services and Termination.</h3>
We are always striving to improve the Services and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. 
This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, 
and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. 
We may even suspend the Services entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as 
safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.

You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in “Settings” in the Service, however 
you will need to manage your in app purchases through your mobile device platform (e.g., iTunes, Google Play). We may terminate 
your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not 
be entitled to any refund for in app purchases.

<h3>5. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Users.</h3>
Though Nudges strives to encourage a respectful user experience through features like closed groups, it is not responsible for the 
conduct of any user on or off of the Services. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other users, particularly if you
 decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person. You should not provide your financial information (for example, your credit 
 card or bank account information), or wire or otherwise send money, to other users.

YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT NUDGES DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND 
CHECKS ON ITS USERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS USERS. NUDGES MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE 
CONDUCT OF USERS. NUDGES RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER 
REGISTER SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS.

<h3>6. Rights Nudges Grants You.</h3>
We grant you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and 
use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services’ benefits as intended by Nudges and 
permitted by this Agreement. Therefore, you agree not to:

<ul>

<h3>7. Rights you Grant Nudges.</h3>
By creating an account, you grant to Nudges a worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to host, 
store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and distribute information you authorize us to access 
from Facebook, as well as any information you post, upload, display or otherwise make available (collectively, “post”) on the 
Service or transmit to other users (collectively, “Content”). Our license to your Content is subject to your rights under applicable 
law (for example laws regarding personal data protection to the extent any Content contains personal information as defined by 
those laws) and is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and researching and 
developing new ones. You agree that any Content you place or that you authorize us to place on the Service may be viewed by other 
users and may be viewed by any person visiting or participating in the Service (such as individuals who may receive shared Content 
from other nudes users).

You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your account, including information submitted from your Facebook account,
 is accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the Content on the Service and grant the license to Nudges above.

You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you post as part of a Service. We may delete any Content, in whole 
or in part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm the reputation of the Service.

When communicating with our customer care representatives, you agree to be respectful and kind. If we feel that your behavior towards any 
of our customer care representatives or other employees is at any time threatening or offensive, we reserve the right to immediately 
terminate your account.

In consideration for Nudges allowing you to use the Services, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place 
advertising on the Services. By submitting suggestions or feedback to Nudges regarding our Services, you agree that Nudges may use and 
share such feedback for any purpose without compensating you.

You agree that Nudges may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good 
faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary, such as to: 
(i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce this Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; 
(iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company or any other person.

<h3>8. Community Rules. </h3>
By using the Services, you agree that you will not:
<ul>
<li>use the Service for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by this Agreement.</li>

<li>impersonate any person or entity or post any images of another person without his or her permission.</li>
<li>bully, “stalk,” intimidate, harass or defame any person.</li>
<li>post any Content that violates or infringes anyone’s rights, including rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark or 
other intellectual property or contract right.</li>
<li>post any Content that is hate speech, threatening, sexually explicit or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or 
graphic or gratuitous violence.</li>
<li>solicit passwords for any purpose, or personal identifying information for commercial or unlawful purposes from other users or 
disseminate another person’s personal information without his or her permission.</li>
<li>use another user’s account.</li>
<li>create another account if we have already terminated your account, unless you have our permission.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to investigate and/ or terminate your account without a refund of any in app purchases if you have misused 
the Service or behaved in a way that Nudges regards as inappropriate or unlawful, including actions or communications that occur off 
the Service but involve users you meet through the Service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. Other Users’ Content.</h3>
Although Nudges reserves the right to review and remove Content that violates this Agreement, such Content is the sole responsibility 
of the user who posts it, and Nudges cannot guarantee that all Content will comply with this Agreement. If you see Content on the Services
 that violates this Agreement, please report it within the Services or via office@nudges.at.

<h3>10. In App Purchases.</h3>
From time to time, Nudges may offer products and services for purchase (“in app purchases”) through iTunes, Google Play or other application
 platforms authorized by Nudges (each, a “Software Store”). If you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details 
 for your account with your Software Store (“your IAP Account”), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in app purchase in accordance 
 with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in app purchases that apply to your IAP Account. 
 Some Software Stores may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through 
 an in app purchase, your IAP Account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you cancel. 
 After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically 
 continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If you do not wish your subscription to renew 
 automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your IAP account and follow instructions
 to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or the Nudges application from your device.

You may be able to purchase, with “real world” money, a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use 
“virtual items". You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Items from us or our authorized partners through the Service and not in any other 
way. Virtual Items represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, 
Virtual Items obtained by you are licensed to you, and you acknowledge that no title or ownership in or to Virtual Items is being 
transferred or assigned to you. This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights in Virtual Items. Any Virtual Item balance 
shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the 
extent of your license. Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use, however, the license granted to you in Virtual Items will terminate 
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, when Nudges ceases providing the Service or your account is otherwise closed or terminated. 
We, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items and/ or may distribute Virtual 
Items with or without charge. We may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time. We shall have no liability 
to you or any third party in the event that Nudges exercises any such rights. The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, and you shall 
not sell, redeem or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity. Virtual Items may only be redeemed through the Service. 
ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. The provision of Virtual Items for 
use in the Service is a service provided by Nudges that commences immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase of such Virtual Items. 
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NUDGES IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION 
FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.

Generally, all charges for in app purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may make 
an exception if a refund is requested within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide 
for refunds.

We will terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.

<h3>12. Disclaimers.</h3>
NUDGES PROVIDES THE SERVICE ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GRANTS NO WARRANTIES OF 
ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE (INCLUDING ALL CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN), 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
NON-INFRINGEMENT. NUDGES DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT (A) THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR FREE, (B) ANY DEFECTS 
OR ERRORS IN THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED, OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE.

NUDGES TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU OR ANOTHER USER OR THIRD PARTY POSTS, SENDS OR RECEIVES THROUGH THE SERVICES. 
ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK.

<h3>13. Third Party Services.</h3>
The Service may contain advertisements and promotions offered by third parties and links to other web sites or resources. Nudges is not 
responsible for the availability (or lack of availability) of such external websites or resources. If you choose to interact with the 
third parties made available through our Service, such party’s terms will govern their relationship with you. Nudges is not responsible 
or liable for such third parties’ terms or actions.

<h3>14. Limitation of Liability.</h3>
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NUDGES, ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE 
LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, 
WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (I) YOUR ACCESS 
TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES, (II) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON, THROUGH, OR 
FOLLOWING USE OF THE SERVICES; OR (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF NUDGES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL NUDGES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED THE 
AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO NUDGES FOR THE SERVICE WHILE YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN 
THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
